## 🎨 提示词（Prompt）备用文字版:

I've decided to amp up the description. The focus is now on achieving the ultimate level of opacity. I'm swapping out the numerical denier for descriptive terms like "super heavy opaque" or "4000D." My goal is to paint a picture of a solid, light-absorbing black silhouette. I am also making sure to preserve the detail about wearing the tights over panties.
